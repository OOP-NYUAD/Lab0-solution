/*4 - A: Write a function to compute Fibonacci number of a non-negative integer. The 
mathematical definition of the Fibonacci number is:
    fib(0) = 0
    fib(1) = 1
    fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
*/

/*4 - B: Write a function that "returns" more than one value. What the function does
isn't actually important.*/
