Git is a distributed version control system. It's primary function is to track changes in files and store them.
This give the user the ability to return to any previous point in the code provided that they committed the changes.

Git is not github. git is not the "offline version of github" either. Github, is a code sharing platform that has
a really nice integration with git.

When using git, you are able to "push" code to and "pull" code from remote repos also using git. github can provide
that remote repo. You can pull code from a remote github repo and push to a github repo (provided you have access)

Why is this all useful? idk, it's fun to think about. It is also necessary to know if you want to work in a
development environment. Below are some useful links that talk about git, github, and github classroom (which we will
also use in this course).

They aren't mandetory, but it will be really nice if you can look at them.

If you are on windows, you can take advantage of github desktop.

Here's the short shortened version of the first video. Git is simple enough to use:

# add changes you made to the repo
# you can specify to add *all* changes by
git add .
# or specific changes by
git add <file1> <file2> ...

# commit changes
git commit -m "add your commit message here"

# upload the changes you made to the remote github repo (the one I will be looking at)
git push
