/*5 - A: Write a program to calculate mean and standard deviation of a one 
dimensional data set (assume data has n entries).*/

/*5 - B: Write a program to take transpose of a matrix and store the 
result in a new matrix. The function prototype will be:

    void transpose(int mat[][MaxDim], int mat_rows, int mat_cols, int transpose[][MaxDim])

You can also assume that MaxDim > mat_rows && MaxDim > mat_cols 
*/

/*5 - C: Write a C++ program to sort the data set in one dimensional 
array in ascending order.*/
